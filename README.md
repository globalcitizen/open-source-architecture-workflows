## Surveying

### Deciding on a survey type

When deciding on a survey type, the main factors are probably legal requirements, accuracy and cost.

Many jurisdictions have legal requirements that licensed surveyors output are submitted in order to approve construction work, which eliminates the option of self-survey. However, __traditional surveyors__ are often expensive, slow (2 weeks to get data is considered fast in some markets!) and low resolution, and may have other problems such as spotty coverage and inaccurate approximations interspersed with precise positioning information.

__DIY surveying__ with video output from a phone or a drone is possible with open source photogrammetry tools, and will result in point cloud data which can be further processed. Photogrammetry based point cloud surveys are also the norm for large commercial and insturial sites which require large scale surveying. Commercial __point cloud surveyors__ increasingly tend to use cloud based services (drone operator uploads video to third party, waits, downloads dataset).
